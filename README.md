# Linktree Template
### Presentation
hi there. How are you? hope you're fine. 😁

In this repository, I would like to make available a website template for people who wants to share your's most important links in any social media. It's very customizable, so you are able to make any changes that you wants.

If necessary, feel free for ask or suggest me about anything. Intend to monitor this repository every day.

## 🎯 Website demo


## 💻 Somethings you can do
The `index.html` can imports two differents snowfall effects, but you must choose between one of these. 
> Don't use both at the same time, it might seem a little strange.

If you want to keep default effect, don't change the lines where are this code:
```
<!-- Snowfall Background Animation -->
<section class="animated-background">
    <div id="stars1"></div>
    <div id="stars2"></div>
    <div id="stars3"></div>
</section>
<!-- End of Snowfall Background Animation -->
```

But, if you want, comment this code above. After commenting the code above, go to the end of `index.html`, you may see a code code like that: 
```
<!-- 
A different snowfall 
<script  src="snowfall.js"></script> 
-->
```
Uncomment this code and press `ctrl+s` for see the updates in your website.
